# Chapter 16 - Moderate

In this chapter, we discuss some moderate-level questions.

## Exercises

#### 16.1 Number Swapper

```java
a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;
```

#### 16.2 Word Frequencies

Use a hash table.

#### 16.3 Intersection

This is a mathematical question. Two infinite lines will always intersect unless they are parallel or the same line. We can compute their respective gradient to check this.

#### 16.4 Tic Tac Win

If we call the function many times, we probably shall hard-code all winning conditions using a bit vector.

#### 16.5 Factorial Zeros

Each trailing 0 means a factor of 10, which means a pair of 2 and 5. We can use two separate procedures to count the number of factors of 2s and 5s. Note that 25 counts for 2 factors of 5s.

#### 16.6 Smallest Differences

- Sort two arrays and do the merging process.
- Store one of them into a hash table.

#### 16.7 Number Max

Use bit operation instead.

#### 16.8 English Int

Use a simple bit-wise iteration. Remember negative sign. Be careful.

#### 16.9 Operations

Use add to implement them. To implement `negate`, use a while loop with the value of the absolute value as the loop counter.

#### 16.10
