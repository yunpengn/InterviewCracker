# Network

In this guide, we introduce some knowledge about computer networking. Specifically, we focus more on the higher layers, such as the application layer (HTTP) and transport layer (TCP & UDP).

## OSI (open systems interconnection) 7-layer model

- 7 layers: application layer, presentation layer, session layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer, physical layer.
- Application layer: HTTP (hyper-text transmission protocol), SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol), etc.
- Transport layer: TCP (transmission control protocol, connection-oriented and reliable) and UDP (user datagram protocol, not connection-oriented and unreliable).
    - However, it turns out QUIC (quick UDP Internet connection) will be used to implement HTTP 3.0. Thus, UDP may not be that bad since it can help to reduce RTT (round-trip time).
- DNS helps to convert domain name to its IP address, while ARP helps to convert IP address to its corresponding MAC address.
- IP addresses are hierarchical, but MAC addresses are not.
    - That's the reason why we can have CIDR (class-less inter-domain routing) using IP addresses.

## Different network I/O models

When a network I/O happens, there are usually 2 phases: a) waiting for data to be ready; b) copy data from kernel to the process. Below illustrates different models for these 2 steps:

- **Blocking I/O:** the process is blocked for 2 phases, and will only resume after both complete.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** the process uses long polling method to keep asking the kernel whether the data is ready. If the kernel returns error (meaning not ready), the process can do something else and ask again later.
- **Multiplexing I/O (event-driven I/O):** use `select/epoll`, able to handle multiple connections concurrently.
    - Internally, `select` uses polling while `epoll` uses callback.
- **Signal-driven I/O:** the kernel uses a signal to notify when phase a is ready, and the process will be blocked for phase b.
- **Asynchronous I/O:** similar to non-blocking I/O, but process does not have to keep asking the kernel. After the initial polling, the kernel will return the process a signal when data is ready.

## What happens when we type an URL and press `Enter` in the browser?

_Below, let's say the entered URL is `https://drive.google.com/`._

- The browser checks in different caches for the DNS record to find the IP address for `https://drive.google.com/`;
    - Usually, it will check caches in the following sequence: browser level, OS level, router level, ISP level.
- If cache miss, ISP's DNS server initiates a DNS query to get the IP address for `https://drive.google.com/`;
    - In this case, the ISP's DNS server is called _DNS recursor_ while the other DNS servers are called _name servers_.
    - There are 3 levels of name servers: ï¼ˆglobal) root name server, `.com` top-level name server, `google.com` second-level name server, and `drive.google.com` third-level name server.
- The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server (identified by its IP address);
    - To establish such a connection, an TCP/IP 3-way handshaking process is performed.
    - 3-way handshake: client sends a SYN packet to server, server responds a SYN/ACK packet, client sends an ACK packet.
- The browser sends an HTTP request to the server with the given port.
- The server handles the incoming request and processes it with a server-side program.
- The server sends an HTTP response back to the client.
- The browser displays the HTML content based on the HTTP response received.

## TCP 3-way handshaking & 4-way handshaking

- 3-way handshaking is used to establish an TCP connection, while 4-way handshaking is used to close an TCP connection.
- TCP 3-way handshaking process:
    - Client to server: SYN = 1, seq = x
    - Server to client: SYN = 1, ACK = 1, seq = y, ack = x + 1
    - Client to server: ACK = 1, seq = x + 1, ack = y + 1
- Why cannot we use 2-way handshaking to establish TCP connection (i.e., without the 3rd step)?
    - Let's say the client sends out an SYN packet but the packet got stuck in the network.
    - After timeout, the client sends out a 2nd SYN packet and this one successfully reaches the server. The server then sends out an SYN/ACK packet and establishes an TCP connection. After a while, the client closes the connection and it is shut down.
    - After a long time, the 1st SYN packet finally reaches the server. The server then sends out an SYN/ACK packet and establishes another TCP connection. However, since the client is shut down already, this connection will never be closed. This is a waste of server resources.
- TCP 4-way handshaking process:
    - Client to server: FIN = 1, seq = u
    - Server to client: ACK = 1, seq = v, ack = u + 1
    - Server to client: FIN = 1, ACK = 1, seq = w, ack = u + 1
    - Client to server: ACK = 1, seq = u + 1, ack = w + 1

## Differences between TCP and UDP

- TCP is connection-oriented and provides reliable connection.
    - TCP does not provide broadcast and multicast.
- UDP is not connection-oriented and provides unreliable connection.
    - UDP is more efficient, thus it is used for DNS, real time media, etc.
- How TCP can guarantee reliable transmission:
    - Sequence number, checksum, duplicate detection, flow control, congestion control, ARQ (auto repeat request), timeout (redeliver).
- Differences between flow control and congestion control:
    - Flow control is to coordinate the speed of the sender and receiver (e.g. receiver is slower than sender and its cache got overflowed). Thus, it is at the end-to-end level within a connection itself, using stop-and-wait and/or sliding window (go back N or selective repeat).
    - Congestion control is to facilitate the entire network globally.

## Differences between HTTP short and long connection

- In HTTP 1.0, short connection is used by default.
- In HTTP 1.1, however, long connection is used by specifying `Connection: keep-alive` in the header.
    - Different from web socket, long connection only eliminates the need for opening/closing TCP connection. The basic HTTP request/response model is still followed per communication.
    - HTTP 1.1 also supports range requests and partial responses for download managers.
- WebSocket creates a persistent, full-duplex connection. This allows the server to push data to the client at any time.
    - WebSocket is not part of the HTTP standard. It is a different protocol.
    - HTTP 2.0 also supports server push. However, this is a bit different from WebSocket as it does not expose APIs to developers.

## Differences between cookie, session and JWT token

- Cookie is stored at the client side, and is used to solve the problem that HTTP is state-less.
- Session is stored at the server side, and has to be used together with cookie by storing a `SESSION_ID` in cookie.
- JWT is stored at the client side (using local storage or session storage), and can solve the scalability problem of the traditional session & cookie approach.
- How to store session when the server side is distributed:
    - Enable sticky session at the load balancer (or reverse proxy) layer;
    - Store the session in a centralized place, such as Redis cache;
    - Use JWT token instead.

## Differences between HTTP and HTTPS

- By default, HTTP is on port 80, while HTTPS is on port 443.
- Although HTTP and HTTPS both run on top of TCP, HTTPS is more secured with the help of TLS/SSL.
    - TLS is the successor of SSL protocol.
- HTTPS guarantees all aspects of a secured communication together:
    - Encryption: all HTTP messages are encrypted with AES (symmetric encryption);
        - Before actual communcation begins, a key exchange process is performed with RSA (asymmetric encryption).
    - Authenticatity: the identity of the server is verified using its X.509 certificate.
    - Integrity: append every HTTP message with a cryptographical hash checksum.

## Differences between a few HTTP status code

- Differences between 301, 302, 307 and 308:
    - 301 stands for `Moved Permanently`. This means the old domain is not accessible anymore and search engine would replace to the new address from now on.
    - 302 stands for `Found`, which means _moved temporarily_. This means this address wants to redirect to another address temporarily only. Search engine would get content from the new address but will still keep the old address.
    - 307 stands for `Temporary Redirect`. It has the same semantics as 302, however, the user agent must NOT change the HTTP method used.
    - 308 stands for `Permanent Redirect`. It has the same semantics as 301, however, the user agent must NOT change the HTTP method used.
- Differences between 401 and 403:
    - 401 stands for `Unauthorized`, although it actually means _not authenticated yet_. The client did not authenticate itself to show the identity to the server yet.
    - 403 stands for `Forbidden`. Different from 401, the client does not have access rights to the requested resources even though its identity is already shown to the server.

## Differences between IPv4 and IPv6

- IPv4 has 2^32 - 1 possible addresses, while IPv6 has 2^128 - 1 possible addresses.
- IPv6 plans to become hierarchical and use some convention similar to CIDR.
