# Java

- Java compilation:
    - `.java`, `.class` and binary files
    - Hotspot, JIT, AoT (ahead of time) compilation
- Difference between Java and C++:
    - Memory management
    - Multi-inheritance
- Difference between override and overload
- Difference between `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer`:
    - Both extend the abstract class `AbstractStringBuilder`
    - `StringBuffer` is thread-safe
    - `StringBuilder` is not thread-safe, but is about 10% better in performance
- Difference between abstract class and interface:
    - Interface only allows public methods, while methods in abstract class allow all different access modifiers
        - Abstract methods in an abstract class cannot be private, though. Otherwise, subclasses cannot see and implement it
    - Methods in interface cannot have implementation, while non-abstract methods in abstract class can
        - Starting from Java 8, interface can declare a method as `default` and have implementation
    - Fields in interface must be `public static final`, while there is no restriction for fields in an abstract class
    - A class can implement multiple interfaces, but can only extend one abstract class
- Difference between `final`, `finally` and `finalize`:
    - `final` is used to declare a class that cannot be inherited, a method that cannot be overridden, or a field whose value cannot be changed
    - `finally` is a block of code that will always be executed no matter `try` or `catch`
        - Code in `finally` will only be skipped if the program, the process or JVM crashes
        - If both `try` and `finally` return a value, the actual return value will be the one from `finally`
    - `finalize` is the method being called by GC before a class is garbage-collected
- Difference between `==`, `equals` and `hashCode`:
    - `==` is used to compare the memory addresses of two objects
    - `equals` is used to compare equality, and will fall back to `==` if it is not overridden in the class
    - `hashCode` is used to compute hash value of an object, and will be used in collection framework such as `HashMap`
    - If `equals` return `true`, `hashCode` must return the same value; but not vice versa
- Difference betwen co-routine, thread and process
- Difference between `Throwable`, `Error`, `Exception`, `RuntimeException` and `assert`:
    - `Throwable` is the most generic class from `java.lang` package
    - `Error` inherits from `Throwable` and represents serious errors that are usually not recoverable. You can but should NOT catch `Error`s
    - `Exception` also inherits from `Throwable`. There are two types of exceptions, checked and un-checked exceptions. An exception becomes an un-checked exception when it inherits from `RuntimeException`, a subclass of `Exception`. Any checked exception must be catched or declared in method signature using `throws`.
    - `assert` is used to verify the correctness of an invariant in the code. They should not be used in production environment. To enable assertion in Java, pass an `-ea` command to JVM.
