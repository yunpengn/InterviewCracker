# Technical Questions - Overview

Technical questions are probably the most significant and basic part of an interview related to IT or computer science (CS) 
fields. In this chapter, we are going to talk about such questions in general and give an overview about how to solve these 
technical questions. Most of them will be on data structure and algorithms.

## How to Prepare

- Try to solve the problem on your own (before looking at the hint and solution).
- Write the code on paper.
- Test the code on paper.
- Type the code _as-is_ into the computer and compile/run it.

## Things to Know

- Core data structures: linked list, tree/trie, graph, stack/queue, heap, vector/array list, hash table.
- Core algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), binary search, merge sort, quicksort.
- Important concepts: bit manipulation, memory management (stack v.s. heap), recursion. dynamic programming (DP), big O 
notation (in time & space).
- Powers of 2 table.
