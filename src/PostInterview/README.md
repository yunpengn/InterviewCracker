# After the interview

Even after you exit the interview room, the interview process is not over yet. You need to wait for the offer and deal 
with it. Here are some useful tips.

## Handling the offer

- Deadline and extension: if you are still awaiting other companies, ask the recruiter to extend the deadline for accepting 
the offer.
- To decline an offer: provide a non-offensive and inarguable reason.
- If you are rejected: do not give up, ask when you can re-apply (usually after 6 months, but take note of the 3 time's 
blacklist rule). You can also ask for any feedback.
- To accept an offer: evaluate the offer based on the financial package, career development, company stability and also, 
your happiness factor.
    - Always try to do some specific negotiation.
    - Think beyond the salary.
- On the job, you should set a timeline for career path, build strong relationships, ask for what you want and keep doing 
more interviews (to sharpen your skills and find more opportunities).
